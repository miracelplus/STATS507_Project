    those who with the bottom 10% income (low income group). We model the level of partisanship in a year for each group as

    fluctuations since 2004, yet both have a slight overall decreasing trend. There is, however, a difference between the
    two groups: it is evident that individuals with the highest personal income have a clearer preference for either the
    Republican or the Democratic party than the individuals with the lowest personal incomes. Further, the difference in
    partisan level between the two income groups exhibits an increasing trend in recent years, caused mainly by a
    significant decrease in partisan level among the low-income individuals since 2016.

    that, overall, young people are most likely to have a positive expection for the economy in the next five years, and
    senior people are usually the most pessimistic among the three age groups. However, this claim starts to break down after
    2016, where nearly in the first time since 1983, young people become more pessimistic about the economy than senior
    people, and has been so for recent years ever since 2016.
