# Group 2 Project for STATS 507: Predicting GDP of the United States of America

This repository contains the code for the Analytics Dashboard for STATS 507. The goal of this project is to create an analytics dashboard application to explore collected data and create predictive analysis models to predict the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States of America. We used Pandas to analyze the datasets, Plotly to graph the data, Dash to build the application, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host the application.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository 
2. Install required packages from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Usage 
1. Run `main.py` with `python main.py` 
2. Access the dashboard by navigating to the localhost URL provided in the terminal (usually [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) )
## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is divided into several sections: 
1. **Project Goals** : A brief introduction to the project and its goals. 
2. **Data Collection** : A description of the data sources used in the project. 
3. **Data Importing** : Information about the data importing process. 
4. **Data Cleaning** : A summary of the data cleaning steps performed. 
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : A section discussing the EDA process and visualizations. 
6. **Predictive Analysis** : A section outlining the predictive models used and their performance on the datasets. 
7. **Final Conclusion** : A summary of the conclusions reached from EDA and prediction.
## Data Sources

Data is collected from the following sources: 
1. [University of Michigan Survey](https://sda.umsurvey.org/sda-public/cgi-bin/hsda2?setupfile=harcsda&datasetname=sca&ui=2&action=subset) 
2. [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) 
3. [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
4. [International Monetary Fund](https://data.imf.org/?sk=388dfa60-1d26-4ade-b505-a05a558d9a42)
## Project Structure 
- `main.py`: The main script for running the Dash application. 
- `data_analysis`: A folder containing the data analysis scripts and modules for each team member. 
- `data`: A folder containing the data files in CSV format.
- `prediction`: A folder containing the prediction scripts and modules for each team member.
